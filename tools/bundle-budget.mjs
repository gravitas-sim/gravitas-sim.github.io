// A ceiling on what a first-time visitor downloads before Gravitas draws
// anything, and a record of why the ceiling is where it is.
//
// The number that matters is the initial download: the CSS plus the JavaScript
// that the entry point pulls in eagerly. Everything else - the lessons, the
// instruments, three.js, Chart.js, the validation worker - is deferred behind a
// dynamic import and arrives only if a reader asks for the feature. That split
// is the architecture's main performance claim, and a budget on the total build
// size would not defend it: adding a megabyte of lazily-loaded lesson content
// is fine, and moving one kilobyte of it into the entry chunk is not.
//
// So there are two budgets, and the deferred one is deliberately loose. The
// tight one is on the initial download, because that is the number a 2019
// Chromebook on a school connection actually waits for.
//
// Raising a budget
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Edit BUDGETS below, in the same commit as the change that needs the room, and
// say in `reason` what was added and why it belongs in the initial download.
// The reason is printed by `npm run budget`, so the history of this file is a
// readable account of where the start-up cost went. That is the whole mechanism:
// growth is allowed, unexplained growth is not.
